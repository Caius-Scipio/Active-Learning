## My process
As I work my way through the exercise library, I do the problems that suit my ability level and interest at the time. Each categorty way given it's own JS file. Some of the scripts need a bit of HTML and CSS to function and see a result, otherwise the results are displayed in the console. My answers will most likely not match the suggested answer, but the results should be similar.
