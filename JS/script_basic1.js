// 135. Write a JavaScript program to remove all characters from a given string that appear more than once.

// 136. Write a JavaScript program to replace the first digit in a string (should have at least one digit) with the $ character.

// 137. Write a JavaScript program to test whether a given integer is greater than 15 and return the given number, otherwise return 15.

// 138. Write a JavaScript program to reverse the bits of a given 16-bit unsigned short integer.

// 139. Write a JavaScript program to find the position of the rightmost round number in an array of integers. If there are no round numbers, the function returns 0.
// Note: A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more zeros.
