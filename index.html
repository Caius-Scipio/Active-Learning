    <h1>The History of the Tabi</h1>
    <p>So, where did the tabby boot come from? Well, the story The tabby starts 
        all the way back in the <strong>15th century</strong> when the 
        predecessor of the tabby was introduced to the island of Japan from China 
        via the Korean Peninsula. Because of the time Japan started importing a 
        lot of cotton from China enabling them to mass produce the very first 
        tabbies. Because <strong>the first tabbies were basically just 
        socks</strong>, and <strong>they didn't even have the split in the 
        toe</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi">Tabi Wikipedia</a></p>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71idPauGRRL._AC_UY1000_.jpg" alt="tabi split-toe shoes">
        
        <p>And then sometime around 1592 the tabby design completely 
        changed it went from that sock design to finally having that split toe 
        design that's so well known with a tabby style. And the reason they did 
        this was not for what you might think they did it because the thong 
        style sandals were so popular at the time. And so they made those socks 
        accommodate those thong style by putting a little slit between the big 
        toe and the rest of your toes. And then sometime later tabby started to 
        be used not just as socks, they started making them out of leather and 
        other materials. They're a little bit more sturdy so that people could 
        use them as basically boots and they called this style jika tabbies, 
        which means tabbies that touch the ground.</p>
        <p>And then as time progressed, 
        the tabby boot slowly changed and around 1657 there was a giant fire that 
        burned out most of Edo and caused the price of leather to increase which 
        led to the tabby boots being made out of other materials like cotton and 
        various sole materials like straw and canvas. And then not a whole lot 
        changed for the next centuries. They were still being used as socks for 
        sandals; as little work boots. Still out of leather from time to time.</p>
        <p>And then fast forward to the turn of the 20th century and rubber 
        manufacturing was in full swing. And then in 1922 Tokujiro Ishibashi 
        and Shojiro Ishibashi who founded Bridgestone tires were Japanese rubber 
        industrialists and they're credited as inventing the very first tabby 
        boots with rubber outsoles. And this newly introduced and heavier duty 
        jika tabby boot was a really popular choice for manual labor jobs like 
        construction, rickshaw drive, and agricultural work.</p>
        <p>And then fast 
        forward to World War II, and we learned this from the Japanese World 
        War II video, where tabby boots were used by a lot of the military 
        for off-duty wear. And then in 1942 the West gets exposed to the tabby
        boot in World War II in a battle in New Guinea where Allied Forces face 
        the Japanese troops who are wearing a split toe boot. And the story 
        went that the Japanese soldiers as they retreated through the muddy 
        jungle, American and Australian forces were easily able to track them 
        due to the distinct pattern of that split toe. And the Allied Forces
        didn't really know what to think of these otherworldly boots and 
        thought they were designed to climb trees and other really cool things 
        that weren't actually the truth. And then in 1949 the shoe company 
        Onitsuka is founded and dabbles in making a split toe tabby running shoe. </p>
        <p>And then in 1951, Japanese marathon racer shigeki Tanaka wins the Boston 
        Marathon wearing a pair of split toe shoes. And following the win, 
        Onitsuka tries to cash in on this split toe sneaker design but it never 
        took off because of how wacky it is. A bit of the 1980s fashion designer 
        Martin margiela visits Japan and has the idea to take this split-toe tabby 
        boot and make it a high heel and mini. Cobblers rejected his idea and refused 
        to make it but in the designer's inaugural 1989 show, the split toe boot 
        debuted and became a polarizing classic immediately. And then in 1996, 
        Nike tries their hand at a minimalist running tabby style shoe with the 
        Air Rift which became a cult hit. But once again never quite took off in 
        the mainstream. </p>
        <p>Next in 2006, Onitsuka tried it again with the 
        collaboration between the Japanese space agency JAXA to make a shoe for 
        astronauts to wear to the journey to the International Space Station. And 
        then fast forward to today, in 2023 and you can buy a pretty wide variety 
        of tabby boots mostly from Amazon. And like cheaper sites, they've got 
        steel toe tabbies, minimalist tabbies, tabbies with laces up the front, 
        slip-on tabbies, so these shoes have a really cool and long history of 
        over 500 years but they've never quite made it into the mainstream. 
        Especially with American audiences. They've mostly been stuck in little 
        niches here and there</p>
